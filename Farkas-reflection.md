GPS 1.1 -- Version Control and Git

-What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I understood the benefits and structure of using git on my own, but using git and GitHub with a partner was hard for me to wrap my head around, having never done it before. 

-What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The process of using GitHub with other contributors was made more clear to me during this module. The more people who can contribute to a repository, the more confusing it can get with all the branches, pull requests, etc. Going through the workflow with a partner and having to fully understand all the contributions to the repo was very illuminating. 

-What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
My partner had accidentally forked the repo even though he was added to the repo as a contributor. That caused a little confusion for our pair so we asked our guide to help clear it up for us. 

-What still confuses you about git?
I think I'm still confused about best practices when it comes to using github. Is it a good idea to edit documents in GitHub and pull from GitHub to local repos, or is it best to edit documents on a local repo then push to GitHub? Or is it a personal preference some people have to do one or the other? 

-How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I loved the experience of my first pairing in a GPS! Both my partner and the guide were enthusiastic, helpful, and supportive. It made me feel like a real developer!
