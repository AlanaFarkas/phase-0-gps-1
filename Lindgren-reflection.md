#### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

###### I was struggling with terminology. I'm still wrapping my head around knowing what all the commands mean, the order in which to execute them, and exactly what is happening with each command that I execute. It was also a new challenge to work with a partner on the same repository.

#### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

###### I do feel that I have a better overall understanding of git. A specific concept that was clarified was how to work on a repository that is on somebody else's github. I was originally the navigator and I mistakenly forked the repository, instead of just cloning it. Now I know what not to do!

#### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

###### I asked them questions about how to push to the correct repository (after I had realized I forked the driver's repository at the beginning). Also, I had just general questions about the workflow and questions to make sure we were both understanding.

#### What still confuses you about git?

###### I understand the process and how it works, but sometimes it can be difficult to get it to work. With more reps, I'm sure this will become routine.

#### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

###### Overall it was a good experience. My partner was knowledgable and helpful. Our guide didn't have much input unless we needed it. He gave us time to try to figure it out only on our own and only spoke if we asked for help.
